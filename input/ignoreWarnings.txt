# MessageHeader profiles do not have separate examples b/c they aren't used indepenently. Instead, profile pages contain links to full message examples for pdmp-messageheader-request, pdmp-messageheader-response, pdmp-parameters-request
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/pdmp/StructureDefinition/pdmp-messageheader-request-op'): The Implementation Guide contains no explicitly linked examples for this profile

# The pattern is set in a repeating slice.  The pattern is expected to hold for all repetitions of that slice.  (It's fixing the 'system' for the identifier.)
# This PDMP profile is based on US Core and adds two typical pharmacy identifiers to the slicing: NCPDP Org ID and DEA registrant

# Informational alerts caused by the validator not finding referenced resources within the same nested bundle as the referencing resource (operation results bundle within a message bundle). Note that when the same bundle is not nested in a message bundle, the validator successfully resolves the references (see the example, Parameters-get-pdmp-history-output-parameters-1)

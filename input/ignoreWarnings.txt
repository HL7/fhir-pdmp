# Quantities for medication products such as tablets or capsules are typically stated as "each" in dispensing and administration processes
UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {each} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked

# The NCPDP Prescription Origin Code is an external code system for which no codes are present in THO
The definition for the Code System with URI 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/NCPDPPrescriptionOriginCode' doesnt provide any codes so the code cannot be validated
Error from http://tx.fhir.org/r4: Unable to provide support for code system http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/NCPDPPrescriptionOriginCode

# Including the patient-animal extension in a Patient example results in this informational message (because patient-animal isn't included in US Core Patient)
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient|6.1.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# MessageHeader and Parameters profiles do not have separate examples b/c they aren't used indepenently. Instead, profile pages contain links to full message examples for pdmp-messageheader-request, pdmp-messageheader-response, pdmp-parameters-request
The Implementation Guide contains no explicitly linked examples for this profile

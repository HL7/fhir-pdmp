# Quantities for medication products such as tablets or capsules are typically stated as "each" in dispensing and administration processes
UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {each} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked

# Using ConceptMap to map between FHIR elements and corresponding fields in related standards. Not using to map between code systems
The Source Code System NCPDP-2017071-NewRx is not fully defined and populated, and no sourceScope is specified, so the source code checking will not be performed
The Target Code System HL7-FHIR-R4 is not fully defined and populated, and no targetScope is specified, so the target code checking will not be performed

# This warning is produced by the publisher because this is a context that was renamed between FHIR versions (per Grahame on Zulip)
The modifier extension http://hl7.org/fhir/1.0/StructureDefinition/extension-ConceptMap.element.target.equivalence from FHIR version {3} is not allowed to be used at this point (allowed = e:ConceptMap.element.target; this element is [[BackboneElement, ConceptMap.group.element.target]; this is a warning since contexts may be renamed between FHIR versions)

# The NCPDP Prescription Origin Code is an external code system for which no codes are present in THO
The definition for the Code System with URI 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/NCPDPPrescriptionOriginCode' doesnt provide any codes so the code cannot be validated
